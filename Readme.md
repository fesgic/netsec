### netsec
- This has been built to complement [netsecurity](https://github.com/fesgic/netsecurity) by providing a user interface instead of a command line.
- UI built with tkinter.
  ### installing dependancies
- To install dependancies, open project folder **netsec** and run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Alternatively, use the venv environment provided:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
### usage
- **Note**, since network capture and most functionalities require root permissions, run the project with superuser permissions to avoid errors:
```
sudo python3 main.py
```
